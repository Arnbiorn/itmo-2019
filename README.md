This package contains all the source code and lecture files.
Any questions? Ask them in our [`gitter room`](https://gitter.im/itmo-2019/community).


## Requirements

You will need:

- [`python3.7`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
- [`poetry`](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry)
- `pycharm` or [`vscode`](https://github.com/sobolevn/dotfiles)


## Marks

We track our progress in [Google Forms]().


## Homework submission

All our homeworks are submitted via Pull Requests.
This is very important, since we learn [how to maintain](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) an [Open Source Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) repository.
There are a lot of tricky parts and manual labour, which we are mastering.

### Process

1. [Create a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/creating-a-pull-request) with files under `students/${YOUR_GTIHUB_ACCOUNT}/${HOMEWORK_NUMBER}`. Do not touch anything else
2. Make sure that [CI works](https://github.blog/2019-08-08-github-actions-now-supports-ci-cd/)
3. Pass a [code review](https://github.com/features/code-review/)
4. Send a link to [`gitter`](https://gitter.im/itmo-2019/community) before the deadline
5. Done!

### Deadline

We have a strict deadline for your homework: each `Thursday at 18:00 UTC+03:00`
Any submission after that time is not counted. But appreciated.


## Final score

```python
final_mark = 0.4 * final_exam + 0.6 * (0.5 * homework + 0.5 * tests)
